Hardware properties discovery for OpenStack Ironic
==================================================

This is an auxiliary service for discovering basic hardware properties for a
node managed by `OpenStack Ironic`_. Hardware introspection or hardware
properties discovery is a process of getting hardware parameters required for
scheduling from a bare metal node, given it's power management credentials
(e.g. IPMI address, user name and password).

Support for *ironic-discoverd* is present in `Tuskar UI`_ -- OpenStack Horizon
plugin for installation of OpenStack using OpenStack technologies (TripleO_).

Hardware properties discovery flow using `Tuskar UI`_ is the following:

* User installs undercloud using e.g. instack-undercloud_ and logs into
  `Tuskar UI`_.

* User uploads CSV file with power credentials for all nodes.

* `Tuskar UI`_:

  * creates nodes in *Ironic* with power credentials populated,
  * sets maintenance mode for these nodes,
  * posts node UUID's to *ironic-discoverd*.

* On receiving node UUID's *ironic-discoverd*:

  * validates the nodes: their power credentials and current power state,
  * allows access to PXE boot service for the nodes,
  * issues reboot command for the nodes, so that they boot the
    *discovery ramdisk*.

* *Discovery ramdisk* collects the required information and posts it back to
  *ironic-discoverd*.

* On receiving data from the *discovery ramdisk*, *ironic-discoverd*:

  * validates received data,
  * finds the node in Ironic database using it's BMC address (MAC address in
    case of SSH driver),
  * fills missing node properties with received data and creates missing ports,
  * sets ``newly_discovered`` flag in node ``extra`` field to ``true``.

Starting *dnsmasq* and configuring PXE boot environment is not part of this
package and should be done separately.

*ironic-discoverd* requires OpenStack Juno (2014.2) release or newer.

Installation
------------

*ironic-discoverd* is available as an RPM from Fedora 22 repositories or from
Juno RDO_ for Fedora 20, 21 and EPEL 7. It will be installed and preconfigured
if you used instack-undercloud_ to build your undercloud.
Otherwise after enabling required repositories install it using::

    yum install openstack-ironic-discoverd

and proceed with `Configuration`_.

Alternatively, you can install package from PyPI_ (you may want to use
virtualenv to isolate your environment)::

    pip install ironic-discoverd

.. _RDO: https://openstack.redhat.com/

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy ``example.conf`` to some permanent place
(``/etc/ironic-discoverd/discoverd.conf`` is what is used in the RPM).
Fill in at least configuration values with names starting with *os_*.
They configure how *ironic-discoverd* authenticates with Keystone.

Also set *database* option to where you want *ironic-discoverd* SQLite
database to be placed.

.. note::
    Configuration file contains a password and thus should be owned by ``root``
    and should have access rights like *0600*.

As for PXE boot environment, you need:

* TFTP server running and accessible.
* Build and put into your TFTP directory kernel and ramdisk from the
  diskimage-builder_ `ironic-discoverd-ramdisk element`_.
  You can also use `kernel`_ and `ramdisk`_ prepared for Instack.
* You need PXE boot server (e.g. *dnsmasq*) running on **the same** machine as
  *ironic-discoverd*. Don't do any firewall configuration: *ironic-discoverd*
  will handle it for you. In *ironic-discoverd* configuration file set
  ``dnsmasq_interface`` to the interface your PXE boot server listens on.
* Configure your ``$TFTPROOT/pxelinux.cfg/default`` with something like::

    default discover

    label discover
    kernel discovery.kernel
    append initrd=discovery.ramdisk discoverd_callback_url=http://{IP}:5050/v1/continue

    ipappend 3

  Replace ``{IP}`` with IP of the machine (do not use loopback interface, it
  will be accessed by ramdisk on a booting machine).

Use `ironic-discoverd element`_ as an example for this configuration.

Running
~~~~~~~

If you installed *ironic-discoverd* from the RPM, you already have a *systemd*
unit, so you can::

    systemctl enable openstack-ironic-discoverd
    systemctl start openstack-ironic-discoverd

Otherwise run as ``root``::

    ironic-discoverd /etc/ironic-discoverd/discoverd.conf

*ironic-discoverd* has a simple client library bundled within it.
It provides function ``ironic_discoverd.client.discover``, accepting list
of UUID's, ``base_url`` --- optional *ironic-discoverd* service URL and
``auth_token`` --- optional Keystone token.

You can also use it from CLI::

    python -m ironic_discoverd.client --auth-token TOKEN introspect UUID

.. note::
    This CLI interface is not stable and may be changes without prior notice.

API
---

By default *ironic-discoverd* listens on ``0.0.0.0:5050``, this can be changed
in configuration. Protocol is JSON over HTTP.

HTTP API consist of these endpoints:

* ``POST /v1/introspection/<UUID>`` initiate hardware discovery for node
  ``<UUID>``. All power management configuration for this node needs to be done
  prior to calling the endpoint.

  Requires X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for authentication.

  Response:

  * 202 - accepted discovery request
  * 400 - bad request
  * 401, 403 - missing or invalid authentication
  * 404 - node cannot be found

  Client library function: ``ironic_discoverd.client.introspect`` for node
  ``<UUID>``.

* ``GET /v1/introspection/<UUID>`` get hardware discovery status.

  Requires X-Auth-Token header with Keystone token for authentication.

  Response:

  * 200 - OK
  * 400 - bad request
  * 401, 403 - missing or invalid authentication
  * 404 - node cannot be found

  Response body: JSON dictionary with keys:

  * ``finished`` (boolean) whether discovery is finished
  * ``error`` error string or ``null``

  Client library function: ``ironic_discoverd.client.get_status``.

* ``POST /v1/continue`` internal endpoint for the discovery ramdisk to post
  back discovered data. Should not be used for anything other than implementing
  the ramdisk. Request body: JSON dictionary with keys:

  * ``cpus`` number of CPU
  * ``cpu_arch`` architecture of the CPU
  * ``memory_mb`` RAM in MiB
  * ``local_gb`` hard drive size in GiB
  * ``interfaces`` dictionary filled with data from all NIC's, keys being
    interface names, values being dictionaries with keys:

    * ``mac`` MAC address
    * ``ip`` IP address

  Response:

  * 200 - OK
  * 400 - bad request
  * 403 - node is not on discovery
  * 404 - node cannot be found or multiple nodes found

Release Notes
-------------

1.0 Series
~~~~~~~~~~

1.0 is the first feature-complete release series. It's also the first series
to follow standard OpenStack processes from the beginning.

See `1.0.0 release tracking page`_ for details.

**API**

* New API ``GET /v1/introspection/<uuid>`` and ``client.get_status`` for
  getting discovery status.

  See `get-status-api blueprint`_ for details.

* New API ``POST /v1/introspection/<uuid>`` and ``client.introspect``
  is now used to initiate discovery, ``/v1/discover`` is deprecated.

  See `v1 API reform blueprint`_ for details.

* ``/v1/continue`` is now sync:

  * Errors are properly returned to the caller
  * This call now returns value as a JSON dict (currently empty)

* Experimental support for updating IPMI credentials from within ramdisk.

  Enable via configuration option ``enable_setting_ipmi_credentials``.
  Beware that this feature lacks proper testing, is not supported
  officially yet and is subject to changes without keeping backward
  compatibility.

  See `setup-ipmi-credentials blueprint`_ for details.

* Add support for plugins that hook into data processing pipeline, see
  `plugin-architecture blueprint`_ for details.

**Configuration**

* Cache nodes under discovery in a local SQLite database. Set ``database``
  configuration option to where you want to place this database.
  Improves performance by making less calls to Ironic API and makes possible
  to get results of discovery.
* Discovery now times out by default, set ``timeout`` option to alter.
* Firewall management can be disabled completely via ``manage_firewall``
  option.

**Misc**

* Support for OpenStack Kilo release - see `Kilo state machine blueprint`_.
* Experimental plugin ``edeploy`` to use with
  `eDeploy hardware detection and classification utilities
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hardware>`_.
* Create ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``.

* ``/v1/discover`` now does some sync sanity checks **[version 0.2.2]**.
* ``discovery_timestamp`` is added to node extra on starting discovery
  **[version 0.2.2]**.
* Nodes will be always put into maintenance mode before discovery
  **[version 0.2.1]**.

**Configuration**

* Periodic firewall update is now configurable.
* On each start-up make several attempts to check that Ironic is available
  **[version 0.2.2]**.

**Misc**
